# The Sherlock plugin

[Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) never runs on the
host. It's invoked through `docker run` against an image pinned by SHA256
digest, with:

- `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`
- `--read-only` root filesystem (only the output volume is writable)
- Memory, CPU, and PID limits

Sherlock's own per-site result is mapped onto our `Status`:

| Sherlock status  | `Status`                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Claimed`        | `FOUND`                                                      |
| `Available`      | `NOT_FOUND`                                                  |
| `Unknown`, `WAF` | `ERROR`                                                      |
| `Illegal`        | dropped (username invalid for that site — no check happened) |

Exposed options: `timeout`, and `nsfw` (also check NSFW sites, excluded
from the default list).
